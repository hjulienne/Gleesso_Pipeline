\usage{
Robust_table_community(graphs_folder, alluvial_diagnostic_file, taxo,
  var = 0.05, N_alluvial = 10, join_type = "outer",
  stability_treshold = 0.6, silhouette_treshold = 0.1)
}
\arguments{
\item{graphs_folder}{: folder where all graphs are placed (with the / at the end please ^^)}

\item{N_alluvial}{: number of graph to represent on a graph}

\item{join_type}{: Should we work on the union of species or the intersection}

\item{alluvial_diagnostic}{: file name for the alluvial graph}

\item{var:}{variability treshold used in Gleesso_bootstrap. if NULL was used in
Gleesso_bootstrap let the default value in this function.}

\item{stability_treshold:}{the stability of a community attribution for a
specific species is the fraction of bootstraps repetition where it was
attributed to the same community. If the species stability is below the
stability_treshold it won't attributed to the robust community.}
}
\value{
a list object containing the following elements:
staby : table of species stability with community assignation for all graphs
stab_n_taxo : table of species stability and taxonomy
Robust_community_stability_[...] : abundance of communities for species with a stability above the specified treshold
Robust_community_stability_[...]_silhouette_[...] : idem but species also have a silhouette above a specified treshold
}
\description{
Compute the stability of
species community attribution from bootstraped graphs and community
table abondance for robust attribution.
