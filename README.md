# Gleesso Pipeline



We implemented the Gleesso pipeline to adapt the SPIEC-EASI pipeline to shotgun MGS abundances. From the Matrix of MGS abundance the pipeline goes through the following step:

* Select MGS that are present in at least 5% of samples and have a mean FPKM abundance of 10âˆ’7 across samples. 
* Infer the graph with the SPIEC EASI pipeline. 
* Infer the community structure with the walktrap algorithm from the igraph R package http: //igraph.org/r/. 
* Output the graph structure to a Gephi https://gephi.org/ compatible format.
* Compute the community abundances by summing the abundance of MGS in the community.


# Installation

The dependency packages phyloseq and SPIEC-EASI (https://github.com/zdk123/SpiecEasi) need to be manually installed before installing Gleesso. 

The following code lines install both the dependencies and the gleesso package.

```r
install.packages('devtools')
library(devtools)

source("https://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
biocLite("phyloseq")

install_github("zdk123/SpiecEasi")
library(SpiecEasi)
install_github("hjulienne/Gleesso_Pipeline/Gleesso")
```
